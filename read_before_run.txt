### Setup and run ###
- Please use Python 3.10 or above due to the use of match statements

1. Tools/requirements.bat OR python -m pip install -r requirements.txt OR pip install -r requirements.txt
2. run main.py

### Run in Idle ###
- If you want to run in idle (or other IDEs) follow these steps.

1. Setup first
2. Modify the script to change the following constants: (Maxs_Modules/renderer.py) compact_console = True, use_colour = False
3. Run main.py with the following arguments: --ide (To do this in idle, go to Run -> Run Module Customized)

- Note (CLI only) --ide tells the program to disable timed input, meaning time limits will not be enforced

### Run on windows 11 ###
- Windows 11 doesn't like the â–‘ symbol in console, so it is recommended to change "divider_symbol"  (Maxs_Modules/renderer.py)

### Modify Script ###
- Some constants in the script can be modified to change the game's behavior
1. game.py : max_number_of_questions = Maximum number of questions per game (shouldn't exceed 50)
2. game.py : max_number_of_players = Maximum number of players per game (shouldn't exceed 4) (apply to bots as well)
3. game.py : host_a_server_by_default = Should the default game be a server (True/False)
4. renderer.py : compact_console = Use the compact variant of the console
5. renderer.py : console_width = Width of the console
6. renderer.py : divider_symbol = Symbol used as borders and such when printing, can be changed on compact console
7. renderer.py : auto_htmlify = Convert text to html when printing to the GUI
