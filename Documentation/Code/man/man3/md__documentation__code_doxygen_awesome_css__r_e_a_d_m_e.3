\fBDoxygen Awesome\fP is a custom \fBCSS theme for Doxygen HTML-documentation\fP with lots of customization parameters\&.

.SS "Choosing a layout"
There is two layout options\&. Choose one of them and configure Doxygen accordingly:
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB1️⃣ Base Theme \fP Comes with the typical Doxygen titlebar\&. Optionally the treeview in the sidebar can be enabled\&.
.PP
Required files: \fCdoxygen-awesome\&.css\fP
.PP
Required \fCDoxyfile\fP configuration: 
.PP
.nf
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # optional\&. Also works without treeview
DISABLE_INDEX = NO
FULL_SIDEBAR = NO
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen\-awesome\-css/doxygen\-awesome\&.css
HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT # required with Doxygen >= 1\&.9\&.5

.fi
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB2️⃣ Sidebar-Only Theme \fP Hides the top titlebar to give more space to the content\&. The treeview must be enabled in order for this theme to work\&.
.PP
Required files: \fCdoxygen-awesome\&.css\fP, \fCdoxygen-awesome-sidebar-only\&.css\fP
.PP
Required \fCDoxyfile\fP configuration: 
.PP
.nf
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # required!
DISABLE_INDEX          = NO
FULL_SIDEBAR           = NO
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen\-awesome\-css/doxygen\-awesome\&.css \\
                        doxygen\-awesome\-css/doxygen\-awesome\-sidebar\-only\&.css
HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT # required with Doxygen >= 1\&.9\&.5

.fi

\fBCaution\fP:
.IP "\(bu" 2
This theme is not compatible with the \fCFULL_SIDEBAR = YES\fP option provided by Doxygen!
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCHTML_COLORSTYLE\fP must be set to \fCLIGHT\fP since Doxygen 1\&.9\&.5!
