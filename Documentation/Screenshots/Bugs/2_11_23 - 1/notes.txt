Bug found is that when adding the correct answer to the question for the options it adds to the "incorrect answers"
array and the prints this. This is an issue because when assigning the "incorrect answers" array to the options array it
is more of a reference (maybe like a c pointer?) to the original array. This causes problems as when saving the file the
correct answer is now saved as an incorrect answer. Then when printing the same question again (ie, second users turn,
restarting) the option is there twice, this is unacceptable as a keen eyed user will be able to notice this behaviour
and then use it to cheat. The workaround was to use the shallow copy function built into python.
