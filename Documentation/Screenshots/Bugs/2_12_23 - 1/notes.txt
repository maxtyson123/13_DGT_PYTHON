This bug was that when trying to select a bot in the scoring menu, it would not print their stats but would print "Press
enter to continue". After a while of debugging I found that this was because of how I indented it (python with its syntax
ugh). What was happening was that it would loop through the users and print the first users stats if that was the one
selected, however it would then show the "Press enter to continue" and re-run the menu where the expected behaviour was
to only print and re-run if the user was selected. To fix this I just added the proper indentation and the also modified
the question marking menus as they also had the same bug
