For some reason when the game was being finished with multiple players the game finished menu was run twice.
This was probably due to when checking if the game was finished it reran the game with the next user which would cause
the check for the game over menu twice, therefore to fix this there needs for there to be a way to check if the current
user finishing is the last user.
