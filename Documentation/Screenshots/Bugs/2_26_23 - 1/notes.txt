In bug_p1 data is seen to be decoded properly, In bug_p2 data (same execution) is it seen to error on decode, this is
due to packet being bigger than the reception buffer size and the program is not checking for this situation
(see old_code). To fix this I made a loop to read the data in chunks and then check for the end of the packet. It loops
reading 4KB at a time storing the chunks in an array (as += on a string would be inefficient) and then joining the array
and trying to decode the data. If the data is not decoded properly it will loop again and read more data. This is
done until the data is decoded properly or the end of the packet is reached.
