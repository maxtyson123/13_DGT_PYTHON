List index out of range error in the server. This was caused by trying to access a user in the game that wasn't there.
This was caused when checking if the proposed user to connect is valid. What happened is that the user was found to have
save data as the run was a continue from file sorta thing and so their progress was sent to be synced. After that the
new proposed user was removed, however the loop continued and tried to access the next user in the array (which had just
been removed). The fix was to break the loop once the sync was complete
